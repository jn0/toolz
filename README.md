toolz
=====

Some tools for Linux boxen on system/z.

There are two things for now:
  1. haedump -- a tool to get dumps in parallel hex-ascii-ebcdic display.
  2. mkdasd -- a tool to produce a clone of the running Linux on a new CCW DASD device.

There is no Makefile or alikes as I see no need for them.
Just 'make haedump' will do the job.
Any install is up to you.
